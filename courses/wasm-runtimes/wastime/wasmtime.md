    - Wasmtime is a standalone optimizing runtime for WebAssembly, the Component Model, and WASI by the Bytecode Alliance. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application. Wasmtime strives to be a highly configurable and embeddable runtime to run on any scale of application.
